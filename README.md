# Circuit Simulator
Generates a topological ordering of gates then performs function simulation of the circuit for a given input vector.

## Topological Sorting

This function takes a blif file as input and generates a topological ordering of the gates of the circuit. Each node is separated by a whitespace.

## Functional Simulation

This function takes a blif file and starting logic value vector as input and propogates the values to the ouput of the circuit.
